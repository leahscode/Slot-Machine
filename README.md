# Slot Machine

This dummy slot machine can be played without inserting real money. It is the perfect tool to explore how likely it is to net a win after multiple rounds. Powered by C# and .NET, it displays any of its ten images on each “reel”. A match equals a win. Go ahead, have a try.
The code for the load and click events are in the [form1.cs file](https://github.com/leahscode/Slot-machine/form1.cs). The app can be downloaded from the [bin/Debug folder](https://github.com/leahscode/Slot-machine/bin/Debug/SlotMachineLS.exe).
